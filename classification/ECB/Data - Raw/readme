In this folder, we have the raw data files.

1) To run the notebooks, you'll first need the ECB speeches file. Unfortunately, due to its size, it's too big to share here on GitHub.
You can find it here: https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/html/downloads.en.html.

2) The Datamart file has extra information, which is not present in the official ECB file, such as the language of the speeches, 
what type of intervention (speech, press conference, etc.). 
It was taken from https://www.kaggle.com/robertolofaro/ecb-speeches-1997-to-20191122-frequencies-dm
