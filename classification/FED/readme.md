In this folder I'll apply NLP techniques to the FED speeches.

11/2021 
In Macroeconomics theoretical models, one quantity of interest is Inflations Expectations.
I've applied BERT-type transformer models, and LGBM (with BOW or Word Embeddings, and multiple inputs) in an attempt
to measure how the FED speeches influence the market indicators of inflation expectations.
So far, the only market indicator I've tried is the 5-Year, 5-Year Forward Inflation Expectation Rate, which can be found at 
[Fred's Database](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/T5YIFR).
